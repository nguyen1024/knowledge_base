## Sync

> If you have Music on your iPhone that does not exist in the iTunes Library on the computer you are syncing to, that music will be removed from the iPhone. Same for Movies and Tv Shows.

> In the case of Music, Movies and TV Shows purchased from the iTunes Store, it will tell you there are  purchases on the iPhone that have not been transferred to the iTunes Library, and you can transfer them before syncing.

> Photos are a bit different. If you Sync Photos to the iPhone it does not overwrite the Photos in your camera roll, but will overwrite any photos that had been previously synced with the new Photo selections.

WTF? I just want to save some voice recordings.
