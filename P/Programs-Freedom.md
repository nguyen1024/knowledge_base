## Proxy

> Some problems with Freedom can be solved by using non-proxy mode.

> Until recently, Freedom required the use of a proxy for blocks to be effective. This could potentially cause issues with:
>
> - Other apps that use a proxy
> - Windows apps such as Microsoft Office, Skype, and other Windows Store apps
> - VPNs
> - Workplace or public computers that don't allow use of a proxy
> - In some cases, slower computer performance

> Now, Freedom has a non-proxy mode that should fix these issues!
