## How to Redirect Output to a File
  
Yes it is possible, just redirect the output (AKA stdout) to a file:

```
SomeCommand > SomeFile.txt
```

Or if you want to append data:

```
SomeCommand >> SomeFile.txt
```

If you want stderr as well use this:

```
SomeCommand &> SomeFile.txt 
```

or this to append:

```
SomeCommand &>> SomeFile.txt 
```

if you want to have both stderr and output displayed on the console and in a file use this:

```
SomeCommand 2>&1 | tee SomeFile.txt
```

(If you want the output only, drop the 2 above)
